       " 'Property Taxes The FY 23-24 recommended budget is balanced with a property tax rate of 67.25 cents, a four cent increase to the adopted rate for FY 22- 23. The tax rate is allocated 62.75 cents to the General Fund, 3.50 cents to the Transit Fund, and 1.00 cent to the Housing Partnership Fund. Property taxes are budgeted at $251.9 million, an increase of $18.6 million, or 7.9%, above the amended current year budget. Property taxes make up about 33.6% of total net revenues. Based on information provided by the Guilford County Tax Department, the tax base is estimated at $37.4 billion with a growth rate of approximately 1.75% for FY 23-24.\\n\\nLocal Option Sales Tax The State of North Carolina grants counties the authority to levy a general local sales tax of up to 2.0%. Counties and transportation authorities are also authorized to levy a public transportation sales tax (subject to voter approval), and counties may authorize a restricted county purpose local sales tax of 0.25% (subject to voter approval). The general state sales tax is currently at 4.75%. Guilford County levies a 2.0% general sales tax. Sales tax distribution among jurisdictions within Guilford County is based on total tax levy of all jurisdictions.',\n",
       " 'Sales tax revenue for FY 23-24 is projected at $88.6 million, representing an increase of $7.6 million above the amended FY 22-23 budget. Projections for FY 22-23 estimate a growth rate of approximately 11% compared FY 21-22 actuals. For FY 23-24, sales tax receipts are projected to increase 4% compared to current estimates. Due to the impact of sales tax distribution based on the overall Guilford County tax levy, receipts for FY 23-24 are expected to decrease by approximately $3 million. This occurs when the City changes tax rates by a lower amount compared to other jurisdictions in the county, primarily the Guilford County tax rate. The result is a projected sales tax growth of almost 7.5%. Local option sales tax revenues constitute about 9.6% of total net revenues.\\n\\nAdopted 2023-24 Budget\\n\\n25\\n\\n@\\n\\nIntergovernmental Revenue Intergovernmental revenues include those revenues that are collected by the State of North Carolina and returned to local governments, such as the Beer and Wine Tax, Utility Sales Taxes, various cable and satellite service sales taxes (now shared with local governments through the Video Services Competition Act), and portions of the state tax on gasoline. This revenue category also includes contributions from Guilford County for support for the City’s Library System, and federal and state grants that help support the Greensboro Transit Agency.\\n\\nIntergovernmental revenues are budgeted at approximately $56.2 million, about $1.3 million more than the revised current year budget. Electric Utility and Piped Natural Gas sales revenues are budgeted at $19.5 million, $1.4 million, or 7.7% higher than the FY 22-23 budgeted amount.',\n",
       " 'Telecommunications, video, and satellite revenues decrease from $4.2 million to $3.5 million, or approximately 19%. This is a continuation of recent trends in decreased revenues from telecommunication sales taxes as consumers continue to abandon landline services.\\n\\nPowell Bill funds, the City’s portion of the state gasoline tax, are budgeted at approximately $8.4 million for FY 23-24, the same as FY 22-23. The budget includes federal and state funding for transit services of $7.5 million, a slight decrease from FY 22-23.\\n\\nShared revenues from beer, wine, and the City’s share of the local ABC distribution of sales taxes are projected to remain the same at approximately $6.5 million. Recent information shared by the local ABC Board indicates that growth in the distribution may be limited in the coming year due to capital plans and State required fund balance needs. Other state shared revenues are expected to remain largely flat overall.\\n\\nUser Fees, Charges and Licenses These revenues primarily represent charges for City services that are provided by departments typically operating as enterprises in separate funds. Examples include water and sewer charges, solid waste transfer station tipping fees, parking deck and on-street parking fees, transit fares, Coliseum parking and concessions, and the stormwater management fee. Charges for services provided by General Fund Departments, such as Parks and Recreation and Engineering and Inspections, are also included in this category.',\n",

Budgeted Water Resources user fee revenue will increase from $133.9 million to $147.8 million, an increase of $13.8 million, or 10.3%, based on service growth and increased rates. An average rate increase of 8.5% is necessary to ensure debt coverage, maintenance, contaminant mitigation, and capacity improvement projections for the water and sewer system. Solid waste landfill and tipping fees are also recommended to increase as contracted service and disposal costs continue to rise.\\n\\nOther Revenues Revenues not otherwise defined are included in this category. These include interest income, internal service charges, proceeds of capitalized leases, donations, and sale of assets. Internal charges, or charges assessed by one department for services rendered for another, are captured in this category. This includes internal printing charges, garage and fleet maintenance charges, and computer service and maintenance charges.\\n\\nRevenues in this category are budgeted for FY 23-24 at $133.5 million, compared to $125.9 million in the current year. Increases are primarily related to improved interest returns for City investments as the markets continue to recover.\\n\\nInterfund Transfers Interfund transfers are contributions made by one fund to support operations in another fund, such as contributions from the General Fund to the Solid Waste Management Fund to support refuse disposal, and contributions to the Debt Service Fund to support voter-approved bond project financing. Budgeted interfund transfers for FY 23-24 are $69.1 million, compared to $66.5 million in FY 22-23.',\n",

The General Fund contribution to the Solid Waste fund increases by $100,000 to $1.9 million to help support disposal and compensation cost increases.

The Water Resources Fund includes an increase of fund balance appropriations of approximately $2.7 million compared to the previous year.\\n\\nFor the General Fund, fund balance appropriation totals $6.5 million, or 1.6%, of the total General Fund budget. This is similar to the previous year appropriation of $6 million. A key priority of the Council is to improve the General Fund fund balance to meet the Local Government Commission’s requirement of 25% operational fund balance.

One FTE is equivalent to one full-time worker, but the term can also encompass part-time workers whose combined hours are equivalent to a full-time position.\\n\\n2. **Position Changes**: This implies that there have been adjustments or modifications in the number of FTE positions. These changes could be due to various factors such as budget cuts, organizational restructuring, new project initiations, or changes in funding.\\n\\n3. **By Fund Type**: This indicates that the changes in FTE positions are being categorized based on the type of funding source. Fund types could include general funds, special revenue funds, enterprise funds, internal service funds, and others. Each fund type typically has specific sources of revenue and designated purposes for expenditure.\\n\\n4. **TOTAL**: This suggests that the summary or report will provide an aggregate or overall view of the FTE position changes across all fund types. It may include a total count of positions added, removed, or reallocated.\\n\\nIn essence, the context is likely referring to a report or analysis that details how the number of full-time equivalent positions has changed, broken down by the different types of funds that support these positions.
